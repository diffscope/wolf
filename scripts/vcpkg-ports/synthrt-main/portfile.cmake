# synthrt, main line: the contribution framework wolf builds on (ContribCategory, PackageLoader,
# SingerCategory). The shared overlay's synthrt port pins the refactor line instead; see vcpkg.json
# for why this one carries a different name rather than shadowing it.

# The onnxruntime-builds-uptake branch carries the ONNX Runtime package uptake and the singer
# category fields wolf reads (languages, defaultLanguage, reservedPhonemes). A fetch by commit
# needs no archive hash.
